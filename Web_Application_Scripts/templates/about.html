<p>A clinical reference laboratory is a private laboratory that allows customers to submit <br>
orders online for medical laboratory tests commonly referred to as ‘blood tests’. Some <br>
examples are companies such as Quest®3 or Any-Lab-Test-Now®2 where customers may <br>
order lab tests online, have their blood drawn, and test results are then produced for <br>
laboratory tests that customers pay for online.</p>

<p>This application hopes to mimic such aforementioned company web pages by strategically <br>
implementing great SQL database DDL and DML design not limited to procedures, triggers, <br>
constraints, and schema design. The web page utilizes the power of Python's Flask library <br>
to incorporate the database in as an object-oriented representation of a relational database.</p>

<p>Once, the database is instantiated with Flask, any number of Python modules can be integrated <br>
to provide any number of functionalities</p>

<p>The main focus of this database was solely on the integration of Flask with SQL database and <br>
the use of proper database DDL and DML techniques. This database is purposely in no way <br>
meant to suffice for security or a high level of database design.</p>
